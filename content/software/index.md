Our lab is committed to developing open-source softwares to advance data science research. Below are some of the software projects we have developed with Python Pypi and/or R CRAN packages.

## Statistics

- **CausalEGM**: A causal inference algorithm that could handle large-scale datasets [[Github](https://github.com/SUwonglab/CausalEGM)][[Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/CausalEGM/)][[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcausalEGM/index.html)][[Website](https://causalegm.readthedocs.io/)].
- **Roundtrip**: A density estimation algorithm using deep generative neural networks [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/Roundtrip)][[Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyroundtrip/)].

## Computational Biology

- **scDEC**: A method for the scATAC-seq and multiome data clustering and embedding [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/scDEC)].
