Our lab is committed to developing open-source softwares to advance data science research. Below are some of the software projects we have developed with Python and/or R packages.

## Statistics
- **CausalBGM**: A causal inference algorithm provides robust uncertainty quantification [[Github](https://github.com/SUwonglab/CausalBGM)][[Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/bayesgm/)][[Website](https://causalbgm.readthedocs.io/)].
- **CausalEGM**: A causal inference algorithm that could handle large-scale datasets [[Github](https://github.com/SUwonglab/CausalEGM)][[Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/CausalEGM/)][[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcausalEGM/index.html)][[Website](https://causalegm.readthedocs.io/)].
- **Roundtrip**: A density estimation algorithm using deep generative neural networks [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/Roundtrip)][[Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyroundtrip/)].
- **scDEC**: A method for high-dimensional data clustering/embedding with applications to the scATAC-seq and multiome data [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/scDEC)].

## Computational Biology

- **DeepCDR**: A graph neural network-based method for the cancer drug response prediction [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/DeepCDR)].
- **hicGAN**: A GAN-based framework for enhancing the resolution of Hi-C data [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/hicGAN)].
- **HiChIPdb**: The first HiChIP database, containing 262 million interactions across 108 cell types [[Database](https://health.tsinghua.edu.cn/hichipdb/)].
