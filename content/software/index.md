Our lab is committed to developing open-source softwares to advance data science research. Below are some of the software projects we have developed. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/kimmo1019) page for software source code.

## Statistics

- **CausalEGM**: A causal inference algorithm that could handle large-scale datasets [[Github](https://github.com/SUwonglab/CausalEGM)] [[Website](https://causalegm.readthedocs.io/)].
- **Roundtrip**: A density estimation algorithm using deep generative neural networks [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/Roundtrip)].

## Computational Biology

- **scDEC**: A method for the scATAC-seq and multiome data clustering and embedding [[Github](https://github.com/kimmo1019/scDEC)].
