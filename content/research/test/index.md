Artificial intelligence (AI) and statistics are two of the most transformative forces shaping modern data science. AI offers unprecedented power to extract patterns, generate realistic data, and model complex systems, while statistics provides the theoretical rigor and principled frameworks necessary for trustworthy, interpretable, and reproducible scientific discovery. The research interests in my lab lie at the intersection of these two fields, developing AI-powered methodologies that decipher the complex relationships hidden within massive biomedical datasets with the principled rigor of statistical science. Through this interdisciplinary research agenda, our lab aims at tackling fundamental challenges in computational biology and biomedical informatics.

Our overarching research goal in our lab is to create next-generation computational frameworks that are computationally efficient, theoretically sound, and powered by advances in generative AI. To this end, we have been developing novel frameworks to address challenges in high-dimensional data analysis, causal inference, and Bayesian computation, with a strong focus on impactful applications in computational biology. We work with diverse and complex datasets, from multiomics, pharmacogenomics to large-scale clinical data, to address pressing questions in biomedicine.

## Vision

The next decades will witness data science advance not just through more powerful AI, but also through the principled integration of AI and statistics. By combining the flexibility and scale of modern AI techniques with the statistical rigor and interpretability, our lab is committed to building this bridge, with a dual focus on methodological innovation and scientific impact. We aim to create tools that are not only pratically powerful but also trustworthy, reproducible, and transformative for the biomedical sciences.
