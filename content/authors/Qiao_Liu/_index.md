Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biostatistics, Yale University. My primary research interest lies in this
multi-disciplinary area where I have been devoting to developing AI-powered computational frameworks with significance in both statistical theory and applications. In particular, I have been exploiting the advances in generative AI to tackle important high-dimensional statistical problems, such as density estimation, causal inference, with wide applications in computational biology, such as single cell genomics, multiomics data integration, and genomic large language models.
